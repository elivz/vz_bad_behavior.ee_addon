VZ Bad Behavior
===============

Uses the open-source [Bad Behavior](http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/) script to block potential spammers, not only from submitting forms, but from even seeing your website. This also helps prevent email-harvesting and server overloads.

Installation
------------

Download and unzip the extension. Upload the "vz_bad_behavior" folder to your /system/expression_engine/third_party/ folder. Finally, enable the extension in your control panel. There are some settings you can use to fine-tune the script, but generally it will work well out of the box.
